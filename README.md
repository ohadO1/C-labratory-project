# 🛠️ Assembler Project
This is my final project for the C lab course in my computer science degree at the Open University, where I developed an assembler from scratch, and scored a 100! 🎉

The assembler reads assembly code, and translates it into machine code. Building this was a fun and challenging experience that improved my understanding of low-level programming.

Enjoy!
